I decided to get back to writing regularly — this time, in public, through this site. Topics will likely revolve around things I have been thinking or learning about at any given moment. I may write about projects I have been working on or just random stuffs that piqued my interest.

The writings may be short and casual and perhaps even biased and wrong. I do not plan on polishing them too much though — I had terrible history with perfectionism. So caveat lector applies and don't forget the salt.
